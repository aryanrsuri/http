I think the way I define a Handler is interensting shoud it be 
{ req res } or { res , options {}} or something else

There is http.Clinent api in zig std... should I use it? not sure how to refactor this 
  @Lookinto

My Routes.zig file might need a restart, as I am not sure how to format this
  Essentially, do i switch on http Methods or are those defined in Req struct first
  @Blocker here

My req.headers and res.headers are identical, which is not correct but not sure how to change this...
  A side-effect is that I couldn't send over text/plain or application/json as this is not set in req Headers Accept
  @Blocker here, i need to figure this one out
